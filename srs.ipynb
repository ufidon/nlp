    "- [Wolfgang von Kempelen’s late 18th-century speech synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfgang_von_Kempelen%27s_speaking_machine) marked the first `text-to-speech (TTS)` system using mechanical components.  \n",

    "## The Automatic Speech Recognition Task\n",
    "- **Dimensions of Variation in ASR:**\n",
    "  - Vocabulary size:\n",
    "    - Small vocabularies (e.g., yes/no, digits) are highly accurate.\n",
    "    - Large vocabularies (up to 60,000 words) in open-ended tasks are more difficult.\n",
    "  - Speaker and context:\n",
    "    - Human-to-machine speech (dictation/dialogue systems) is easier.\n",
    "    - Read speech (e.g., audiobooks) is relatively easy.\n",
    "    - Conversational speech between humans is the hardest due to faster, less clear speech.\n",
    "  - Channel and noise:\n",
    "    - Quiet environments with head-mounted microphones are ideal.\n",
    "    - Noisy settings (e.g., streets, open car windows) complicate recognition.\n",
    "  - Accent and speaker characteristics:\n",
    "    - Recognition is better for accents/dialects similar to the training data.\n",
    "    - Regional/ethnic dialects and children's speech are more challenging.\n",
