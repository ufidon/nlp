# [Overview of Natural Language Processing (NLP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)

What is NLP?
---
- NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics.
- It enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- NLP is critical in the era of big data, AI, and human-computer interaction, and AGI.


[Artificial general intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence)
---
- A hypothetical type of artificial intelligence (AI) that can learn, understand, and apply information across a range of tasks and domains, similar to humans. 
- It aims to mimic human cognitive abilities and is different from narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks. 
- AGI would be able to adapt to new situations, solve advanced problems, and perform critical thinking. 
- In theory, AGI could complete tasks it wasn't trained for and perform creative actions that humans can't.


Brief History of NLP
---
- Early Beginnings (1950s-1980s):
  - Mention the Turing Test (1950).
  - Early attempts like machine translation (e.g., Georgetown-IBM experiment in 1954).
- Rule-Based Systems (1960s-1980s):
  - Hand-coded rules and symbolic approaches e.g.:
    - [ELIZA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)
    - [SHRDLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHRDLU)
- Statistical Methods (1990s):
  - Introduction of statistical models, like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for tasks such as speech recognition.
- Deep Learning Era (2010s-Present):
  - Discuss the rise of neural networks, word embeddings, and transformers.


Key Concepts in NLP
---
- Tokenization:
  - Breaking text into words, sentences, or other meaningful elements.
- Morphology:
  - Study of word structure and formation.
- Syntax:
  - Rules governing sentence structure.
- Semantics:
  - Understanding the meaning of words and sentences.
- Pragmatics:
  - How context influences the interpretation of language.


Principles of NLP
---
- Ambiguity:
  - How NLP deals with the inherent ambiguity in human language (e.g., lexical, syntactic, and semantic ambiguity).
- Contextuality:
  - Importance of context in understanding meaning.
- Statistical and Neural Approaches:
  - Combining large datasets with statistical models to capture language patterns.


Common NLP Algorithms
---
1. Text Preprocessing:
   - Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop-word removal.
2. [Bag of Words (BoW)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model):
   - Simple model to represent text data.
3. Word Embeddings:
   - Vector representations of words, e.g., 
     - [Word to vector (Word2Vec)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec)
     - [Global Vectors (GloVe)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GloVe)
4. Sequence Models:
   - Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).
5. Transformers:
   - Explain transformers and the self-attention mechanism,e.g., 
     - [Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/bert)
     - [Generative Pre-Training  (GPT)](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/openai-gpt)
6. Named Entity Recognition (NER):
   - Identifying and classifying entities in text.
7. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Determining the sentiment expressed in text.


Applications of NLP
---
1. Machine Translation:
   - Real-time translation (e.g., Google Translate).
2. Speech Recognition:
   - Converting spoken language into text (e.g., Siri, Google Assistant).
3. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants:
   - Automating customer service and personal assistance.
4. Sentiment Analysis:
   - Analyzing opinions in social media, reviews.
5. Text Summarization:
   - Condensing large texts into summaries.
6. Information Retrieval:
   - Search engines and question answering systems.
7. Natural Language Generation:
   - Generating human-like text (e.g., automated content creation).
