    "## Overview\n",
    "- `Question answering (QA) systems` have supported human information needs since the 1960s, advancing over time with innovations like IBM’s Watson, which surpassed human performance on \"Jeopardy!\" in 2011.\n",
    "  - They are integrated with search engines and modern large language models (LLMs), enhancing their ability to answer diverse queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Prompt-based methods` in modern QA use pretrained LLMs to directly answer fact-based questions from stored knowledge.\n",
    "  - LLMs often produce `hallucinations`, confidently giving incorrect answers, especially in specialized domains, due to poor calibration.\n",
    "  - `Simple prompting LLMs` limits their ability to access proprietary or real-time data, as they cannot update information after training.\n",
    "  - `Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)` overcomes these issues by combining `document retrieval` with LLMs, grounding answers in relevant, curated data and enabling responses based on proprietary information.\n",
    "  - RAG uses `information retrieval techniques`, from tf-idf to neural models like BERT, to select relevant documents, enhancing answer reliability and context-awareness."
