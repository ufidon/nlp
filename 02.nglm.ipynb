    "## **Purpose of Language Models**\n",
    "   - **Probability Assignment:** LMs assign a `probability` to `each possible next word, phrase, or sentence` based on `the context provided by the preceding words`.\n",
    "     - computes $P(w|c)$, the `probability` of a word $w$ given some context $c$.\n",
    "   - **Applications:** Used in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks like \n",
    "     - speech recognition, \n",
    "     - machine translation, \n",
    "     - text generation and autocomplete,\n",
    "     - augmentative and alternative communication (aac) systems, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Types of Language Models**\n",
    "   - **Unigram Model:**\n",
    "     - **Description:** Assumes each word is `independent` of the previous words.\n",
    "       - Which is unlikely in NLP.\n",
    "     - **Example:** Probability of the sentence \"I love NLP\" is $P(\\text{\"I\"}) \\times P(\\text{\"love\"}) \\times P(\\text{\"NLP\"})$.\n",
    "     - **Limitation:** Ignores context, leading to unrealistic predictions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - **N-gram Model:**\n",
    "     - **Description:** Considers the context of the previous $N-1$ words.\n",
    "     - **Example:**\n",
    "       - **Bigram Model (N=2):** $P(\\text{\"love\"} | \\text{\"I\"}) \\times P(\\text{\"NLP\"} | \\text{\"love\"})$\n",
    "       - **Trigram Model (N=3):** $P(\\text{\"NLP\"} | \\text{\"I love\"})$\n",
    "     - **Usage:** \n",
    "       - N-gram statistics capture diverse linguistic phenomena, including: \n",
    "         - syntactic patterns, task-specific tendencies, and cultural preferences. \n",
    "       - These probabilities reflect: \n",
    "         - grammatical rules, domain-specific language use, and societal trends in word co-occurrences.\n",
    "     - **Padding**: Extra context marks are needed at the start and end of sentences for longer n-grams\n",
    "       - e.g with trigrams, we use two special markers `<s>` before the first word to calculate `𝐏(\"I\"|<s><s>)`\n",
    "     - **Limitation:** The model might struggle with `rare or unseen` word sequences due to `data sparsity`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Neural Language Models:**\n",
    "     - **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):**\n",
    "       - **Description:** Uses a feedback loop to take into account all previous words, maintaining context across varying lengths.\n",
    "       - **Example:** Predicts the next word in a sequence like \"I love\" by using hidden states that summarize previous words.\n",
    "       - **Limitation:** Can suffer from issues like vanishing gradients, especially with long dependencies.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     - **Transformers:**\n",
    "       - **Description:** Uses attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies without the sequential nature of RNNs.\n",
    "       - **Example:** Models like GPT, BERT use transformers to predict the next word or even fill in masked words in a sentence.\n",
    "       - **Advantage:** Handles long-term dependencies more effectively and is highly parallelizable."

    "  - Perplexity is a measurement of `how well a probability model predicts a sample`.\n",
    "  - It is used to evaluate the performance of language models in NLP.\n",
    "- **Key Idea:**\n",
    "  - `Lower perplexity indicates a better model`, as it suggests the model is less \"perplexed\" by the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mathematical Definition of Perplexity**\n",
    "- **Formula for Perplexity:**\n",
    "  - `Perplexity (PP)` of a model over a sequence $W$ of words $w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_N$:\n",
    "  - $\\displaystyle \\text{PP}(W) = P(W)^{-\\frac{1}{N}} = P(w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_N)^{-\\frac{1}{N}} = \\sqrt[N]{\\frac{1}{P(w_1, w_2, \\dots, w_N)}} = 2^{-\\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\log_2 P(w_i | w_{1:i-1})}$\n",
    "    - $=\\displaystyle\\sqrt[N]{∏_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{P(w_i)}}$ (for unigram model)\n",
    "    - $=\\displaystyle\\sqrt[N]{∏_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{P(w_i|w_{i-1})}}$ (for bigram model)\n",
    "    - $=\\displaystyle\\sqrt[N]{∏_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{P(w_i|(w_{i-1},w_{i-2}))}}$ (for trigram model)\n",
    "- **Explanation:**\n",
    "  - $P(W)$: Probability of the entire sequence.\n",
    "  - $N$: Number of words in the sequence.\n",
    "  - The lower the perplexity, the higher the probability the model assigns to the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🍎**Perplexity Example**\n",
    "- **Given Sequence:** \"I love NLP\"\n",
    "- **Assume:** Bigram Model with probabilities:\n",
    "  - $P(I) = 0.1$\n",
    "  - $P(love | I) = 0.3$\n",
    "  - $P(NLP | love) = 0.5$\n",
    "- **Calculate:**\n",
    "  - $P(W) = 0.1 \\times 0.3 \\times 0.5 = 0.015$\n",

    "### **Perplexity in Language Model Evaluation**\n",
    "- **Intrinsic Metric:**\n",
    "  - Perplexity is an intrinsic evaluation metric used to assess language model quality.\n",
    "- **Comparison:**\n",
    "  - Used to compare different language models on the same dataset.\n",
    "- **Interpretation:**\n",
    "  - A lower perplexity score indicates a better language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Perplexity and Language Models**\n",
    "- **Perplexity** is influenced by both the text and the language model. \n",
    "  - Different n-gram models will have varying perplexities for the same text.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Perplexity allows us to compare the effectiveness of different n-gram models.\n",
    "- 🍎 **Example**: \n",
    "  - Trained unigram, bigram, and trigram models on 38 million words from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) with a 19,979 word vocabulary.\n",
    "  - **Test Set**: Perplexity calculated on a 1.5 million word WSJ test set.\n",
    "  - **Perplexity Results**:\n",
    "    - Unigram: 962\n",
    "    - Bigram: 170\n",
    "    - Trigram: 109\n",
    "  - **Interpretation**: Trigram models, which have more contextual information, are better predictors (lower perplexity) than unigrams and bigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Important Considerations in Perplexity Evaluation**\n",
    "- **Model Construction**: The n-gram model must be built without prior knowledge of the test set or its vocabulary to avoid artificially low perplexities.\n",
    "- **Comparability**: Only comparable if models use identical vocabularies.\n",
    "- **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Evaluation**:\n",
    "  - **Intrinsic**: Perplexity improvement doesn't always translate to better performance in tasks like speech recognition.\n",
    "  - **Extrinsic**: End-to-end evaluation on real tasks is recommended to confirm improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Perplexity as Weighted Average Branching Factor**\n",
    "- **Branching Factor**: The number of possible next words that can follow any given word in a language.\n",
    "- **Perplexity Interpretation**: Perplexity can be seen as the weighted average of this branching factor.\n",
    "  - For a language where all digits (0-9) are equally probable, the perplexity would equal 10.\n",
    "  - $\\displaystyle PP(W)=\\sqrt[N]{∏_{i=1}^{N}\\frac{1}{P(w_i)}}=\\sqrt[10]{∏_{i=1}^{10}\\frac{1}{1/10}} = \\sqrt[10]{∏_{i=1}^{10}10} = 10$\n",
    "- **Influence of Probability Distribution on Perplexity**\n",
    "  - **Unequal Distribution**: If one digit (e.g., 0) is much more frequent, the perplexity decreases\n",
    "    - as the next digit becomes more predictable.\n",
    "  - 🍎 e.g.: With a test set dominated by the digit 0, the weighted branching factor is lower than 10\n",
    "    - reflecting a decrease in perplexity due to predictability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Limitations of Perplexity**\n",
    "- **Dependence on Dataset:**\n",
    "  - Perplexity is sensitive to the domain and type of text in the dataset.\n",
    "- **Doesn’t Measure Understanding:**\n",
    "  - A model might have low perplexity but still lack true understanding of the language.\n",
    "- **Bias Towards Shorter Sequences:**\n",
    "  - Models may achieve low perplexity by favoring shorter sequences, which may not always be desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Practical Application of Perplexity**\n",
    "- **Use in Research:**\n",
    "  - Perplexity is widely used in NLP research to gauge model improvements.\n",
    "- **Example Application:**\n",
    "  - Evaluating different versions of an n-gram model on a test corpus.\n",

    "## **Sampling Sentences from a Language Model**\n",
    "- **Definition**: \n",
    "  - Sampling from a language model involves generating sentences by choosing words based on their likelihood according to the model's distribution.\n",
    "  - More likely sentences (according to the model) are sampled more frequently, while less likely ones are sampled less frequently.\n",
    "- **Importance**: \n",
    "  - Sampling helps to visualize the kind of knowledge a language model holds by generating sentences it considers probable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Historical Context and Unigram Sampling\n",
    "- **Historical Context**:\n",
    "  - The idea of sampling from language models was first suggested by Shannon (1948) and Miller and Selfridge (1950).\n",
    "- **Unigram Sampling**:\n",
    "  - Imagine the words of a language spread out across a probability space from 0 to 1.\n",
    "  - Each word occupies an interval proportional to its frequency.\n",
    "  - **Process**:\n",
    "    1. Choose a random number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "    2. Identify the word whose interval includes this number.\n",
    "    3. Continue generating words until the sentence-final token `</s>` is selected.\n",
    "- **Visualization**:\n",
    "  - A cumulative probability line where frequent words (e.g., \"the\", \"of\") occupy larger intervals, \n",
    "    - and rare words (e.g., \"polyphonic\") occupy smaller intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bigram Sampling\n",
    "- **Bigram Sampling Process**:\n",
    "  - Start by generating a bigram that begins with `<s>` based on its probability.\n",
    "  - The second word of the bigram becomes the first word of the next bigram.\n",
    "  - Repeat the process, generating each subsequent word based on the previous one.\n",
    "- **Key Concept**:\n",
    "  - Sampling bigrams provides a more contextual generation compared to unigrams, \n",
    "    - as each word is dependent on the previous one.\n",
    "- **Application**:\n",
    "  - By sampling bigrams, one can visualize how the model predicts word sequences and generates more natural sentences compared to unigrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sampling Strategies**\n",
    "- **Greedy Sampling**:\n",
    "  - Always select the word with the highest probability.\n",
    "  - **Pros**: Produces highly probable sentences.\n",
    "  - **Cons**: Can result in repetitive or deterministic text.\n",
    "- **Random Sampling**:\n",
    "  - Select words based on their probabilities, allowing less probable words to be chosen.\n",
    "  - **Pros**: Produces more diverse sentences.\n",
    "  - **Cons**: May result in less coherent text.\n",
