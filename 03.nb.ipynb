    "    - **Sentiment analysis** (positive/negative)\n",
    "      - Used to determine a writer's emotional stance toward a product, topic, or service.\n",

    "- **Example**: In **5-fold cross-validation**, the data is split into 5 parts:\n",
    "  - Train on 4 folds, test on 1 fold, and repeat 5 times.\n",
    "  - Average the results from each iteration to get a robust estimate of the model’s performance.\n",

    "  - Helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.\n",
