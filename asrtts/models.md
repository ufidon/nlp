## ASR and TTS models

### ASR Models:
1. **Whisper by OpenAI**:
   - A state-of-the-art ASR model capable of transcription, translation, and other tasks, using a robust transformer-based architecture.
   - [Whisper API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/whisper).

2. **DeepSpeech by Mozilla**:
   - An open-source speech-to-text model based on a recurrent neural network (RNN).
   - [DeepSpeech GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mozilla/DeepSpeech).

3. **Kaldi**:
   - A highly customizable framework for building ASR systems, popular in academic and research circles.
