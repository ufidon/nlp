    "\n",
    "- **Attention Formula Adjustment**:  \n",
    "  ![Matrix masks](./images/mlm/mask.png)\n",
    "  - In causal transformers (a), the attention formula includes a masking step:\n",
    "    - $𝐀 = \\text{softmax} \\left( \\text{mask} \\left( \\dfrac{𝐐𝐊^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) \\right) 𝐕$\n",
    "  - In bidirectional transformers (b), the mask is removed:\n",
    "    - $𝐀 = \\text{softmax} \\left( \\dfrac{𝐐𝐊^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}} \\right) 𝐕$\n",
    "    - enabling full context access across the input sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization of Input**:  \n",
    "  - The model uses subword tokenization methods, such as WordPiece, SentencePiece or BPE, processing subword tokens instead of whole words.\n",
    "  - Subwords may need to be mapped back to words for certain NLP tasks like parsing.\n",

    "    - Replaced with a special token `[MASK]`.\n",
    "    - Replaced with a random token sampled from the vocabulary based on unigram probabilities.\n",
    "    - Left unchanged.\n",

    "    - 10% are replaced with a random token.\n",
    "    - 10% remain unchanged.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Training Objective**:\n",
    "  - The model predicts the original value of each modified token using a bidirectional encoder, with a cross-entropy loss guiding the parameter updates.\n",
    "  - All input tokens participate in the self-attention process, but only sampled tokens contribute to training loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Probability Calculation and Loss Computation**:\n",
    "  ![Masked language model training](./images/mlm/trmask.png)\n",
    "  - Each modified token’s embedding vector is processed through transformer layers, generating a final output vector $𝐡^L_i$.\n",

    "    - $𝐮_i = 𝐡^L_i 𝐄^T$\n",

    "    - $𝐲_i = \\text{softmax}(𝐮_i)$\n",
    "  - The loss for a token $x_i$ is based on the probability assigned to the correct word, given the modified sequence $𝐱^{\\text{mask}}$:\n",
    "    - $L_{\\text{MLM}}(x_i) = -\\log P(x_i | 𝐡^L_i)$\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Training Efficiency**:\n",
    "  - Only tokens in `the set $M$ (sampled tokens)` contribute to training updates, meaning only 15% of input tokens drive weight adjustments, which is relatively inefficient."

    "  - Mask-based learning primarily focuses on predicting words based on context, but many applications require understanding `relationships between sentence pairs`, such as:\n",
    "    - Paraphrase detection (similar meanings),\n",
    "    - Entailment (checking logical implications or contradictions),\n",
    "    - Discourse coherence (ensuring sentences logically follow each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) Task**:  \n",
    "  - To capture inter-sentence relationships, some BERT models include an NSP objective, where the model predicts if two sentences are adjacent (50% true pairs, 50% random pairs).\n",
    "  - The NSP loss evaluates the model's ability to distinguish actual sentence pairs from random ones.\n",

    "  ![An example of the NSP loss calculation](./images/mlm/nsp.png)\n",

    "    - `[CLS]` is prepended to the input, and `[SEP]` is placed between and after the sentence pair.\n",
    "    - Segment embeddings distinguish each sentence, enhancing sentence pair differentiation.\n",

    "- **Training Datasets and Scale**:\n",
    "  - Early transformer models, like BERT, were trained on 3.3 billion words from English Wikipedia and BooksCorpus.\n",
    "  - Modern masked language models use larger, filtered datasets from web text, augmented with higher-quality sources like Wikipedia.\n",
    "  - Multilingual model XLM-R was trained on 300 billion tokens across 100 languages from the web via [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/).\n",

    "- **Training Setup for BERT**:\n",
    "  - BERT models sample pairs of text segments from the corpus using the NSP objective (50/50 real or random pairs) with a 512-token limit.\n",
    "  - Tokens within these pairs are masked according to MLM, and the combined MLM and NSP losses are used in training, with approximately 40 epochs needed for convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Modifications in Models like RoBERTa**:\n",
    "  - RoBERTa omits the NSP objective, instead using contiguous sentences as input and padding until 512 tokens are reached.\n",
    "  - This approach typically uses large batch sizes, between 8K and 32K tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vocabulary and Tokenization for Multilingual Models**:\n",
    "  - Multilingual tokenization often faces data imbalance; sampling too many sentences from high-resource languages (like English) can bias the vocabulary.\n",
    "  - To counter this, models divide training data into subcorpora by language, rebalancing tokenization probabilities to upweight underrepresented languages, improving multilingual performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Multilingual Model Advantages and Challenges**:\n",
    "  - Multilingual models offer practical advantages over creating many monolingual models and improve low-resource language performance by leveraging data from related, high-resource languages.\n",
    "  - However, with many languages, these models suffer from a `curse of multilinguality`, where performance degrades per language, and a `linguistic accent` where high-resource language structures (often English) influence lower-resource languages."
