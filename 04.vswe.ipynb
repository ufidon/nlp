    "### **Challenges with PMI**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Issues with Negative PMI:**\n",
    "  - Negative PMI values suggest that two words co-occur less often than expected by chance, but these values can be unreliable unless the corpus is extremely large.\n",
    "  - For example, distinguishing whether two words with very low probabilities occur together less often than by chance would require vast amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Bias Towards Infrequent Events:**\n",
    "  - PMI tends to give high values for rare word pairs even if their co-occurrence is not meaningful.\n",
    "  - Example: A rare term like \"quantum\" paired with \"entanglement\" might have an inflated PMI due to their low individual frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on NLP Models:**\n",
    "  - This bias can lead to incorrect conclusions about word associations and affect downstream tasks such as topic modeling or semantic similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Positive Pointwise Mutual Information (PPMI)**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Positive PMI (PPMI)** sets all negative PMI values to zero, making it more robust against unreliable associations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - $\\displaystyle \\text{PPMI}(w, c) = \\max \\left( \\log_2 \\left( \\frac{P(w, c)}{P(w)P(c)} \\right), 0 \\right)$\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why Use PPMI?**\n",
    "  - It focuses only on positive associations, eliminating misleading negative values.\n",
    "  - PPMI is commonly used in word embeddings and vector space models, where negative PMI values do not contribute meaningful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  - If PMI for (word1, word2) is -2, PPMI sets it to 0.\n",
    "  - If PMI for (word1, word2) is 4, PPMI retains the value of 4.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "  - **W rows:** Represent words in the vocabulary.\n",
    "  - **C columns** Represent contexts (surrounding words).\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Constructing the PPMI Matrix:**\n",
    "1. Calculate the joint probability $p_{ij}$ of $w_i$ and $c_j$:\n",

    "2. Calculate the marginal probabilities of word $p_{i*}$ and context $p_{*j}$:\n",
    "   - $\\displaystyle p_{i*} = \\dfrac{∑_{j=1}^C f_{ij}}{ ∑_{i=1}^W ∑_{j=1}^C f_{ij}}  \\quad  p_{*j} = \\dfrac{∑_{i=1}^W f_{ij}}{ ∑_{i=1}^W ∑_{j=1}^C f_{ij}}$ \n",

    "- **Why Laplace Smoothing?**\n",

    "  - Larger $k$ values discount more, reducing PMI bias further.\n",
