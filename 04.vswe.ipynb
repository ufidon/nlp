    "- **Bias Towards Infrequent Events:**\n",
    "  - PMI tends to give high values for rare word pairs even if their co-occurrence is not meaningful.\n",
    "  - Example: A rare term like \"quantum\" paired with \"entanglement\" might have an inflated PMI due to their low individual frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Impact on NLP Models:**\n",
    "  - This bias can lead to incorrect conclusions about word associations and affect downstream tasks such as topic modeling or semantic similarity.\n",

    "  - It focuses only on positive associations, eliminating misleading negative values.\n",

    "- **Context Window Size**:\n",
    "  - Smaller windows (e.g., ±2 words) capture **syntactic similarity**\n",
    "    - e.g., similar parts of speech\n",
    "  - Larger windows (e.g., ±5 words) capture **topical or semantic similarity**.\n",
    "- **Examples**:\n",
    "  - **Window ±2**: *Hogwarts* → *Sunnydale*, *Evernight* \n",
    "    - similar fictional schools\n",
    "  - **Window ±5**: *Hogwarts* → *Dumbledore*, *Malfoy*, *half-blood*\n",
    "    - related to Harry Potter\n",
    "- **Types of Word Association**:\n",
    "  - **First-order co-occurrence**: Words that occur nearby\n",
    "    - e.g., *wrote* with *book* or *poem*\n",
    "  - **Second-order co-occurrence**: Words with similar neighbors \n",
    "    - e.g., *wrote* with *said* or *remarked*\n",

    "### **Analogy and Relational Similarity**\n",
    "- **Parallelogram Model**:\n",
    "  - Used to solve analogies: *apple:tree::grape:vine*.\n",
    "    - Given $a,b,a^*$ in $a : b :: a^* : b^*$, $b^*$ can be found by\n",
    "      - $\\hat{b^*} = \\arg\\max_{x} \\text{distance}(x, b-a+a^*)$\n",
    "  - The vector from *apple* to *tree* is applied to *grape* to find *vine*.\n",
    "- **Word2Vec/GloVe Success**:\n",
    "    - **king** - **man** + **woman** ≈ **queen**.\n",
    "    - **Paris** - **France** + **Italy** ≈ **Rome**.\n",
    "  - Embeddings capture relations like **MALE/FEMALE**, **CAPITAL/CITY**.\n",
    "- **Limitations**:\n",
    "  - May return input words or morphological variants \n",
    "    - e.g., *cherry:red* :: *potato:x* → *potato*\n",
    "  - Performs well on frequent words and common relations but struggles with more complex associations."

    "- **Analyzing Semantic Shifts**:\n",
    "  - Embeddings from different time periods show how word meanings evolve.\n",
    "  - Separate embedding spaces are built for each decade from historical corpora (e.g., Google N-grams, Corpus of Historical American English).\n",
    "- **t-SNE Visualization Example**:\n",
    "  - Changes in word meanings over two centuries (e.g., *gay*, *broadcast*, *awful*).\n",
    "  - **Gay**: Shift from \"cheerful\" to referring to homosexuality.\n",
    "  - **Broadcast**: Shift from \"casting seeds\" to \"transmitting signals.\"\n",
