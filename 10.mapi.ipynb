    "- **Prompting LLMs with Natural Language**: \n",
    "  - Large language models (LLMs) can perform tasks like translation, summarization, and sentiment analysis through `natural language prompts`, which act as `instructions` for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **In-Context Learning**: \n",
    "  - Prompts serve as a learning signal, allowing LLMs to learn new tasks through `example-based instructions` `without altering their internal parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Limitations of Pretraining**: \n",
    "  - LLMs are often ineffective at following instructions precisely due to insufficient pretraining; \n",
    "  - `instruction tuning`, which finetunes models on specific instructions and responses, helps improve task accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety and Harm Prevention**: \n",
    "  - Pretrained LLMs can generate harmful or unsafe outputs; \n",
    "  - addressing this involves training for safety during instruction tuning to prevent harmful language or misinformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Alignment**: \n",
    "  - To better align LLM behavior with human values, `preference alignment techniques` like RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) are used alongside instruction tuning, \n",
    "  - enhancing model responses to align with user goals and safety standards."

    "## Prompting\n",
    "- **Purpose of a Prompt**: A prompt is a text input that guides a language model (LLM) to perform specific tasks by providing context for generating relevant outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Creating effective prompts for various tasks is known as `prompt engineering`, crucial for guiding LLMs to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Classification Example**: \n",
    "  - For sentiment analysis, a prompt like “In short, our stay was…” can lead an LLM to generate contextually fitting completions, such as negative or positive summaries.\n",
    "- 🍎 **Example**: \n",
    "  - Prompt: “Did not like the service that I was provided... In short, our stay was”\n",
    "  - Output: “…not a pleasant one. The staff at the front desk were not welcoming or friendly.”\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task Versatility with Contextual Prompts**: LLMs can perform multiple tasks (e.g., summarization, translation, truthfulness check) by simply adjusting the prompt context.\n",
    "  - With the right prompts, a single LLM can adapt to different tasks, requiring minimal additional information to produce relevant responses."
